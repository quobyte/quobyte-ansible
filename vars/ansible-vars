## Global registry configuration: valid for clients and servers
# This variable can be either a list of IP addresses , a list of 
# DNS A-Records (both corresponding to your inventory registry section)
# or a DNS SRV record (that, in turn, resolves to all hosts from
# the inventory registry section).
# Registry entries:
registry: example-host-a.com,example-host-b.com,example-host-c.com 

## Ansible configuration:
# Quobyte API endpoint to talk to
# You can either chose one explicit API host address here
# or, in case you will use a HTTP loadbalancer for your 
# API endpoints, the address of that loadbalancer.
# Can be an IP-Address or DNS A-Record entry.
# It is only used by Ansible and is independent from the 
# resulting Quobyte installation
api_service: example-host-a.com
